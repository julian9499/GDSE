Introduction
============

Since January 2020, the world has been in a global pandemic due to the
COVID-19 virus. Since the breakout of this pandemic, many people were
forced to work remotely, to prevent human contact and avoid spreading
the virus. In March 2020, more than 3.4 billion people in 84 countries
have been restricted by the confines of their home [^2]. This
disrupting shift in working environment has had many consequences, such
as having to communicate through video conferencing using utilities like
Zoom or Microsoft Teams, having limited access to physical working tools
and potentially having to manage both work and family. This rapid shift
in environment and working activities can have both positive and
negative psycho-social effects and impact on productivity, and in this
paper, we try to analyze, present the possible effects and come up with
some approaches to create a better environment for yourself when working
from home.

Interaction between worker and occupation
=========================================

The impact of working from home on both productivity of employees as
well as the overall happiness and satisfaction of these employees also
heavily depends on the kind of work they do. For example, a high school
teacher would have enormous benefit on working on premise with the
students while a distributed software engineer is barely effected by the
restrictions in place [^10] [^3]. Having a
direct connection with people hugely benefits productivity in all cases
however the impact can differ from occupation to occupation and even
from person to person as individual preferences, personality and
behaviors also have a significant impact on the level of productivity
and study even shows that individual characteristics and preferences
outweigh the occupational characteristics [^9].

Advantages and disadvantages of working from home
=================================================

Working from home can be a relief for some people, because they can
spend more time with family or avoid the daily commute. Working from
home can also have its downsides, such as not having the right equipment
at home and missing formal or informal contacts that are the norm at the
workplace. It is important to notice that the majority of people seem to
have had a positive experience in the shift of working on-location to
working from home [^7]. The advantages and disadvantages of
working from home due to COVID-19 seem to be clear for both managers and
employees [^7].

Advantages
----------

Both managers and employees seem to have a better work-life balance,
which can be attributed to factors such as less time in travelling and
closer contacts to family [^7]. This change in work-life
balance does seem to impact different people in a different way, a study
in Japan, for example, shows that mothers shoulder the burden of working
remotely and caring for small children that get their education in
primary school. Fathers seem to prefer working on-location whenever
possible. Parents of children from junior high school and upwards do not
seem to be affected as much by this asymmetric effect [^12].
Overall, managers and employees seem to have an increased work
efficiency and greater work control. This means that both parties have
greater control on what work they do and little distractions from
external factors.

Disadvantages
-------------

As expected, we can see that managers and employees have encountered
some difficulty in adapting to this new life. One of the main downsides
of working from home is that the home-working environment is not up to
par in comparison to the regular working environment. This is mainly due
to inadequate tools and work uncertainties. The latter seemed to have
impacted young people more than older generations. A disadvantage that
could be more severe is the increased sitting time of
employees [^8]. The sitting time that was attributed to people
sitting in cars has decreased, but the overall sitting time has
increased which could result in health risks such as higher risk of
Diabetes Mellitus and increased mortality [^11].

Working from home and productivity
==================================

There exist some well-known articles by influential people who are
advocating for people to work more from home to raise productivity. One
of those articles is by Nicholas Bloom, a researcher widely known for
his research showing the benefits of working from home and whose
philosophy has been copied by many employers and employees to avoid the
long commutes and create a better work-life environment [^1].
However, the very same man changed his perspective after COVID and says:
“Everyone assumes I would be gushing over the global roll-out of working
from home. Unfortunately not.” [^6]. Bloom argues
that the most challenging aspect of working from home is managing the
kids. Schools have closed down so the kids are getting taught at home
while the parents are working there which effectively gives them a
second job as teacher. He argues that for his initial plan to raise
productivity by working from home, the kids being in daycare or at
school is a must. While he advocated for working from home before, the
current situation is completely different thanks to four factors the
coronavirus brings with it: children, space, privacy and choice. He also
fears that the missing productivity leads a slump in innovation which
would mean there are going to be fewer new innovative ideas and thus
products hitting the market in 2021 and beyond.

Best approach to working from home
==================================

Everybody is different however, we have thought, followed the video’s of
IN4185 and discussed with the people around us about several things you
could do to make working from home more bearable during these times of
crises. Naturally, this differs from employer to employee because as an
employer you want to go that extra stretch to put your employees at
ease.

Employee
--------

1.  Try to communicate with your co-workers more often. You could call
    them on Zoom or via Teams, also there are more tools created each
    day where interaction becomes even more natural such as getMibo.[^12]

2.  Go outside once in a while. Feeling isolated can reduce productivity
    and your working morale so try to go outside once in a while. Go
    play with the kids, walk your dog or just get some fresh air.
    Everyone is in this together.

3.  Try to remember you are still doing your job. Working from home is
    so easily accessible that some of you might start working still in
    your bathrobe. However, this gives you a mental note that this is
    not serious thus making you less productive and giving less
    motivation. Try always to get your morning routine in and get
    dressed before you start your work day. This reminds you that what
    you are doing is a serious job and on top of that gives you a nice
    morning routine.

Employer
--------

1.  Software Engineers at Microsoft have stated that they felt
    overworked and were having too many meetings during the COVID-19
    pandemic [^4]. This shows that working from home is
    not necessarily less stressful, which you might expect due to less
    distractions, more time with family and less time in commute. It is,
    therefore, important for companies to keep an eye on the workload of
    the employees and the results they are producing. It is more
    difficult to notice when an employee is struggling when you do not
    see them in real life. Try to keep the meetings to a minimum and
    check up on them how they are doing and what they need to do their
    job correctly.

2.  Employees have reported that they do not always have sufficient
    tools at home to do their work as well as they would
    on-location [^7]. Also, a high level of autonomy can
    result in a stressful experience for employees [^5]. Not all
    employees will speak up about this, or employees might not know that
    there was a way for them to be productive. Making sure that
    employees have the right tools at their disposal and making sure
    that their needs have been heard will strengthen the relationship
    between the employee and you as a manager and the company you work
    for.

3.  Working from home can result in a feeling of isolation for
    employees, because informal interactions are very hard to replace in
    a WFH-environment. Informal activities are therefore a must to keep
    people from feeling lonely and disconnected from the team. These
    activities can take many forms, such as an online game, an online
    interactive get-together application such as getMibo, or a simple
    video call where employees are not forced to talk about work, but
    are encouraged to talk about personal things.

Conclusion
==========

Working from home can be a challenge for some while a relieve for
others, everyone is his or her own person with his or her own
preferences. Some people work more efficiently from home than from their
office and their work-life balance seems to have been improved. The
obvious downsides should also be taken into account, such as the
necessity to avoid isolation and do regular exercise. All things
considered, working remotely can be a positive thing for many
individuals, allowing software development to be a more accessible job.
The clear advantages that have been uncovered by the COVID-19 pandemic
should be taken into account by both managers and employees to provide
employees with an optimal working environment with the highest degree of
work satisfaction. However, the negative effects that working from home
brings should not be overlooked. Because it is such a novel idea to work
fully remote from home, there are still many tools not invented or not
yet at the state to improve the quality of life in a remote environment.
However, as Nicholas Bloom already said, working from home is a no-go
when you are under the influence of the four factors the coronavirus
bring. Luckily, there is enough you can already do to improve the remote
working life for you.
